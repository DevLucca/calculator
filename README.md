# Basic HTML CSS JS / Go Calculator [Equation Parser]

## Description
This repository is a basic calculator example that uses Frontend and Backend practices.
This layout was made so one could easily see a working calculator with REST API calls.

# How to use
First of all, you will need to install the Golang programming language.
I've also made available the binary file of the Backend application in the repository.
Keep in mind that the binary file is compiled with the Go compiler on a MacOS machine. This means that on a Windows Machine, this binary file will not work.

If you prefer using the "interpreter" of the Go programming language, you can use the following commands:
```sh
go get -u ./...
go run server.go
```

## Usage
If you want to use as compiled mode:
```sh
./server
```
OU
```sh
go run server.go
```

And then you can open the `front/app.html` file in your browser.
